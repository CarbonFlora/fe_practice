## Initial HW Run
1) 
y=2.4x + b
3=2.4*5 + b
b = -9

y=2.4x + -9
[b]

```
You can also use the Table function to enter your eq and determine intersection.
```

2)
[b]
? Forgot actual form of circle.

```
You need to know your polar coordinate system. C+f for 'circle' and it gives you the eq for circle.

(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2
multiply everything out, simplify and you get it.
[d]
```

3)
Use sys-solv on calc.
[a]

```
No extra notes.
```

4)
Inverse of y=3^x  
x=3^y
logx = 3y
? Forgot how to do inverse.

```
Flip the x and y is an inverse. C+f for 'Logarithms'.
x=3^y
log x = log 3^y
log x = y * log 3
y = log_3 x // log x / log 3 == log_3 x
[c]
```

5)
cos + sin * sin/cos
cos + sin^2/cos
? which trig identity

```
Take a look at the trig identity sheets. Convert everything to either sin or cos
sin^2 + cos^2 = 1
  sin^2 = 1 - cos^2
-> cos + sin^2/cos
cos + 1/cos - cos^2 / cos
cos + 1/cos - cos
1/cos
sec(x)
[a]
```

6)
guessing
[a]

```
x = pi/2 radians == 90 deg
cos(90 deg) == 0
Trial and error the answers.
[c]
```

7)
Outer triangle: 5:12:13gle C = tan^-1(5/12) 
  = 22.62 deg
Part triangle large(am) = sin(22.62) * 12 = 4.615 
Part triangle large(mc) = cos(22.62) * 12 = 11.0769 
[b]

```
Triangle math checks out.
```

8)
Parabola= 2bh/3= 2*8*6/3 + 8*6
[d]

```
Parabola equation is much faster. Good job.
```

9)
? forgot how to find tangent to parabola

```
Find the slope that matches the other function. 
f_1 = 2x - 4 
f_1 = 2x - 4 = 2
x = 3
f_1 = 3^2 - 4*3 + 2
f_1 = 9 - 12 + 2
f_1 = -1
f_2 = -1 = 2(3) + b
b = -7
[a]
```

10)
sin, cos, -sin, -cos
guessing [a]

```
when taking derivative of this, its: u * dv/dx + v * du/dx
-sin(2x) |  4e^(4x)
cos(2x) * 4e^(4x) + e^(4x) * (-2sin(2x))
e^(4x)(~)
[c]
```

11)
area between curves.
intersections at:
x^2-3x=0
x(x-3)=0
x=0,3

12-7.5 = 4.5
[b]

```
Use the integral function on calc. 
```

12)
? how tf to integrate sec^2

```
trig again.
tan^2 + 1 = sec^2
sec^2 - 1 = tan^2
integral(tan^2)
  = tan(x) - x + c
[b]
```

13)
Use vector/dot-product func on calc.
[d]

```
No extra notes.
```

14)
use vector/cross-product func on calc.
[c]

```
No extra notes.
```

15)
? Are you supposed to normalize to 1 // no
[b]

```
Add the parts of the vectors, then divide by |c| or SQRT(i^2 + j^2 + k^2)
[d]
```

16)
[d]

```
Brute forced by plotting it. 
A dot B = |A| * |B| * cos(theta)
theta is the angle between A and B.
```

17)
use ox as this is sample rather than population
[a]

```
THIS IS WRONG. If it's greek, then that's population. Use Sx.
[b]
```

18)
? forgot the correct function on calc.

```
This is a Z-test. (Unit Normal Distribution)
(u - x)/(o/SQRT(n))
Test Statistics
Z_var = (4400 - 4000)/(200/SQRT(1))
  = 2
```

19)
2.44*10 - 2.84
[c]

```
Use the calc function.
```

20)
? ik it's binomial, but pdf or cdf, how to make eq.

```
P = n!/(x!(n-x)!) * p^x * q^(n-x)
P_4 = 5!/(4!(5-4)!) * .6^4 * .4^(5-4)
Also have to do P_5
// n: pulls 
// x: required for success
// p: probability of success
// q: probability of failure
```
